[Download a PDF Version of the CFP](files/cfp_sac2020.pdf)

The 27th Conference on Selected Areas in Cryptography (SAC 2020) will take place as an online  conference on October 21 -23, 2020, and will be preceded
by the SAC "Summer" School on October 19-20, 2020. SAC 2020 is held in cooperation with the International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR).

## Topics

Authors are encouraged to submit original papers related to the following three regular topics for SAC 2020:

1. Design and analysis of symmetric key primitives and cryptosystems, including block and stream ciphers, hash
functions, MAC algorithms, and authenticated encryption schemes.

2. Efficient implementations of symmetric and public key algorithms.

3. Mathematical and algorithmic aspects of applied cryptology.

In addition, the following topic as the special topic for SAC 2020:

4. Secure Elections and Related Cryptographic Constructions
SAC 2020 also welcomes papers in any of the areas above with a focus on post-quantum cryptography.
The SAC 2020 proceedings will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.

## Instructions for Authors

* Papers must be submitted electronically; the submission link will be made available at https://sac2020.ca/.
Late submissions, submissions by email, or hardcopy submissions will not be accepted.
* Submissions must be anonymous, with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgments or obvious references.
* Papers must be typeset using [LaTeX in the LNCS style](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/
lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines) with no alterations to font size or margins, with the exception
of using `\pagestyle{plain}` to add page numbers. The main body of the paper must be at most 20 pages in
length including bibliography. It is possible to have clearly marked appendices, as long as the total length of
the paper does not exceed 30 pages. Program Committee members are not required to read appendices, so the
paper should be intelligible without them.
* Papers must be written in English, and begin with a title, a short abstract, and a list of keywords. An
introduction section should summarize the paper’s contributions at a level appropriate for a non-specialist
reader.
* Submissions must be in PDF format.

Submission implies the commitment of at least one of the authors to present the paper at the conference. Note that
due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the conference will be held in an online manner. The SAC 2020 Chairs reserve the
right to withdraw papers from the proceedings that are not presented at the conference or for which the camera-ready
post-proceedings version is not submitted by the deadline.

### Irregular submissions ###

SAC 2020 follows the IACR’s Policy on Irregular Submissions. Submissions must not
substantially duplicate work that any of the authors has published elsewhere or has submitted in parallel to a
journal or any other conference/workshop that has proceedings. The SAC 2020 Chairs reserve the right to share
information about submissions with other program committees or journal editors to detect parallel submissions. In
addition, the SAC Chairs reserve the right to contact an author’s institution/corporation and/or other appropriate
organizations if an irregular submission is detected. Submissions not meeting these guidelines risk rejection without
consideration of their merits. For further details, please refer to the [IACR Policy on Irregular Submissions](https://www.iacr.org/docs/irregular.pdf).

### Conflicts of interest ###

SAC 2020 follows the IACR’s Policy on Conflicts of Interest (COI). Authors, program
committee members, and reviewers for SAC 2020 must adhere to the IACR Policy on Conflicts of Interest. Authors
are requested to identify all members of the SAC 2020 Program Committee who have an automatic conflict of
interest with the submission, and disclose it at the time of submission. It is the responsibility of all authors to ensure
correct reporting of COI information. Submissions with incorrect or incomplete COI information may be rejected
without consideration of their merits. For further details, please refer to the [IACR Policy on Conflicts of Interest](https://www.iacr.org/docs/conflicts.pdf).

### Code of conduct ###

While being held as an online event, SAC 2020 is committed to providing an experience free of
harassment and discrimination, respecting the dignity of every participant. Participants who violate this code may be
sanctioned and/or expelled from the event, at the discretion of the Chairs. Serious incidents may be referred to the
IACR Ethics Committee for further possible action as well as to the relevant enforcement agency. Any action will
only be taken with the consent of the affected party subject to applicable laws.

If you experience harassment or discriminatory behavior at SAC 2020, we encourage you to reach out to any of the
SAC 2020 Chairs.

If you witness harassment or discriminatory behavior, please consider intervening.

## SAC “Summer” School ##

The SAC Summer School will be held prior to SAC, on October 19–20, 2020, in an online manner. The purpose
of the SAC Summer School is to provide participants with an opportunity to gain in-depth knowledge of specific
areas of cryptography related to the current SAC topics by bringing together world-class researchers who will give
extended talks (half-day) in their areas of specialty. The SAC Summer School is open to all attendees, and may be of
particular interest to students, postdocs, and other early-career researchers. For more information about this year’s
SAC Summer School, visit https://sac2020.ca/summerschool.html.
