# Selected Areas in Cryptography (SAC) 2020

SAC is Canada's research conference on cryptography, held annually since 1994. The details of the 27th edition of SAC are currently being updated - due to travel restrictions the planned location (Halifax) will no longer be available! If a virtual conference is possible, the dates will be adjusted to allow required additional time. Please check back on for more details (hopefully last week of April for final details).
