## Video Presentation Format

Each session will be approximately 1 hour long, with 3-5 papers presented during each session.

* You will give a **5 min live presentation (paper overview)** during your session.
* There will be a **20-30 min Live Q&A / Discussion** after all papers present their overview.
* The longer "full conference talk" will also be linked, but not played during the session. Details of recording this are below.

### Recording Video

* We are requesting all authors record **one** full-length (approx 25-min) video. Note it's not a strict timing requirement on the 25-min video, as if you are shorter/longer it does not impact our schedule.
* The videos should be ideally in a MP4 format, but any reasonable format will be accepted. Note that the SAC2020 chairs may re-encode any videos & normalize audio levels between them if required.
* One of the easiet methods of doing this is now using the free and open-source [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) tool, which works on all major platforms.
* You can see a [Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTjVBlnEiNI) of using a recent version of OBS, which includes the entire process on Windows of installing OBS & recording a PowerPoint presentation.
