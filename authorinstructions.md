## Video Preperation

### Recording Video

* We are requesting all authors record a XX minuite video, which should be ideally in a MP4 format, but any reasonable format will be accepted. Note that the SAC2020 chairs may re-encode any videos & normalize audio levels between them.
* One of the easiet methods of doing this is now using the free and open-source [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) tool, which works on all major platforms.
* You can see a [Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTjVBlnEiNI) of using a recent version of OBS, which includes the entire process on Windows of installing OBS & recording a PowerPoint presentation.
